## üìñ Description

**SIEM-lite** is a lightweight, modular **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** tool built in Python. It parses and analyzes logs (e.g., SSH logs) to detect potential security threats such as:
- Brute-force login attempts
- Logins from new IPs
- Failed-then-success login sequences
- Logins outside business hours

Includes a **Streamlit-powered dashboard** for real-time viewing and status updates.
